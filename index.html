    <h2>Short Project Description</h2>

    <div class="block">
      The DLC ecosystem boasts excellent libraries, yet it falls short on
      readily available components for building DLC applications. <code>dlcdevkit</code>
      fills this gap as an application development kit incorporating both
      <code>rust-dlc</code> and <code>bdk</code>. It provides robust libraries for transport, data
      storage, and oracle clients, enabling seamless integration for application
      development.
    </div>

    <h2>Long Project Description</h2>

    <div class="block">
      <p>
      <code>dlcdevkit</code> is an application development kit for the DLC ecosystem.
      Application developers can build their application without having to worry
      about the underlying wallet, how to perform DLC communication, contract
      data storage, and interfacing with oracles. Existing applications can also
      easily add DLC support by importing the <code>dlcdevkit</code> crate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of marketplaces for offering/accepting DLCs has stifled the
        discovery of contracts between counterparties. <code>dlcdevkit</code> would build an
        agnostic DLC marketplace. An early front runner for implementation is
        NIP 88. This allows application developers to focus on the user
        experience and the heavy lifting of marketplace discovery to <code>dlcdevkit</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>dlcdevkit</code> improves and iterates on DLCs by contributing and maintaining
        the <code>rust-dlc</code> library. An activation of a covenant soft fork would
        improve the efficiency of DLCs. <code>dlcdevkit</code> moves the DLC ecosystem
        forward by introducing DLC covenants. https://github.com/bennyhodl/dlcat
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>dlcdevkit</code> builds support for WASM and various language bindings to
        broaden accessibility and functionality.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Potential impact</h2>
    <p>DLCs introduce self-custodial, non-interactive financial contracts to Bitcoin, enhancing its utility and appeal. Traditionally, application developers have been compelled to divert resources from UI/UX development to create their own DLC implementations using basic libraries. This often results in fragmented solutions that lack interoperability across marketplaces. <code>dlcdevkit</code> seeks to unify these disparate efforts, fostering a cohesive ecosystem. Given the growing interest in Bitcoin for financial contracts and gambling, <code>dlcdevkit</code> is poised to bridge the gap, enabling a broader adoption and development within the DLC ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Project Timelines and Potential Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Months 1-2:</strong> Establish the core framework by building the foundation of the <code>rust-dlc</code> and <code>bdk</code> crates.</li>
      <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Develop supporting crates for data storage (including sqlite, vss, indexed db), transport (such as nostr and matrix), and the oracle client (kormir).</li>
      <li><strong>Months 7-8:</strong> Implement WASM and various language bindings to broaden accessibility and functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Months 8-10:</strong> Launch the NIP 88 Nostr marketplace to facilitate efficient discovery and interaction within the ecosystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Months 10-12:</strong> Integrate covenant support (cat, ctv, txhash, etc.) to enhance the capabilities and efficiency of DLCs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ongoing initiatives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Continuous maintenance of the <code>rust-dlc</code> library.</li>
      <li>Development of Kormir digit decomposition.</li>
      <li>Collaboration with application developers to integrate and optimize the <code>dlcdevkit</code> platform.</li>
    </ul>
